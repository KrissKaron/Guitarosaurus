# Guitarosaurus

Desktop app (to be moved to browser extension) that uses AI to recognize guitars from videos and compare to a database,
with the scope of giving the user the exact model and/or similar models based on specs.

Currently working best: Main branch - Windows OS - Chrome browser

TODO:
- finish scraper script on Ubuntu + Firefox version (2nd branch)
